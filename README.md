Minimal ayon docs server. it's an example for showing how splitting docs into their dedicated repo works.

when running this docs server, it will fetch files from [ayon-documentation](https://github.com/ynput/ayon-documentation/) repo.

> [!NOTE]
> Relative links to other docs for example [docs/artist_tools_workfiles](docs/artist_tools_workfiles) 
> won't work here.
